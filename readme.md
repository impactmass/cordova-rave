## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have signed up for a Rave account. If not, go [here](https://www.rave.flutterwave.com) to signup for a ```live``` account or [here](https://www.ravesandbox.flutterwave.com) to signup for a ```test``` account.

Ensure that you have ```nodejs``` and ```npm``` installed. If download Nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org) and install it.
> Installing ```nodejs``` also install ```npm``` with it.

Once you have ```nodejs``` and ```npm``` installed, proceed install cordova using the command below

```
npm i -g cordova
```
**NOTE:** if you are a MAC or Linux user, you might need to append ```sudo``` before ```npm i -g cordova``` __i.e__
```
sudo npm i -g cordova
```

### Installing

The following steps will get you up and running.

1. Create a sample cordova project in your favorite directory

    **NOTE:** You can skip this step if you already have a cordova project
    ```
    cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
    ```
    *This command will create the required directory structure for your cordova app. By default, the cordova create script generates a skeletal web-based application whose home page is the project's www/index.html file.*

2. Test your sample project to be sure everything is working fine.

    *We would be testing in the browser environment. To test on other environments check out the cordova documentation on [android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html) and [ios](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html).*
    Run the following commands in order
    ```
    cd hello
    cordova platform add browser
    cordova run browser
    ```
    If everything works out. Life is good. **Moving On**

3. Install Rave
    - Navigate into your app directory (if you aren't already there). If you are using the same directory as this documentation, do ```cd hello```
    - Run the following commands in order
    ```
    npm install cordova-rave
    cd node_modules/cordova-rave && npm start
    ```
    **NB: If you get a warning of outdated npm dependency/DOS issue, please [read this](https://github.com/impactmass/cordova-rave/issues/11#issuecomment-293965034)**

    **NOTE:** Once the second command installs all the necessary dependencies, you will be prompted to enter some information. An example is shown below

    ```
    prompt: PBFPubKey:  FLWPUBK-98765445678900987698765567-X

    prompt: amount:  1

    prompt: customer_email:  user@user.com

    prompt: currency:  NGN

    prompt: country:  Nigeria

    prompt: custom_title:  Cordovey

    prompt: custom_description:  Testing

    prompt: redirect_url:  https://yourredirecturl.com

    prompt: payment_plan_id:  1000

    prompt: payment_options:

    prompt: subaccounts:  []

    prompt: custom_logo: logo.png

    prompt: liveMode:  yes
    ```

    >PBFPubKey: This is your Rave public key and can be gotten from your rave dashboard

    >amount: The amount you want to charge your customers. If omitted, A customer will be able to specify the amount

    >customer_email: this is the merchant's email address

    >currency: The currency you want to charge your customers in. If omitted, it defaults to NGN

    >country: The merchant's country. Defaults to Nigeria

    >custom_title: A title for your payment

    >custom_description: Text describing what your customers are paying for

    >redirect_url: This is the url that rave sends the response of your transaction to. It should be configured to handle a get request. If not supplied, no response will be sent from Rave

    >payment_plan_id: If you want to bill your customers recurrently, pass in the payment plan id here. It must be an integer

    >payment_options: This allows you select the payment option you want for your users.

    >subaccounts: This is an array of objects containing the subaccount IDs to split the payment into.

    >custom_logo: Link to the Logo image.

    >liveMode: This determines if you want to use the live apis (yes) or the test apis (no). It is required

4. Generate rave.js.
    While you're still in ```node_modules/cordova-rave``` directory, run:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    This ultimately creates a rave.js file into your www directory.

5. Link rave.js file to index.html in www directory

    Add the following script tag just before your closing script tag
    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="rave.js"></script>
    ```
    >Voila!!!! With rave.js now linked, you can call the function below (as you please), passing in an object containing the properties listed above. An example is shown below
    ```
    initRavePay({
        'PBFPubKey': 'FLWPUBK-54567898978675645342334567-X',
        'amount': '0',
        'currency': 'NGN',
        'country': 'NG',
        'customer_email': 'user@example.com',
        'customer_firstname': 'Jon',
        'customer_lastname': 'Snow',
        'pay_button_text': 'Pay now',
        'custom_title': '',
        'custom_description': '',
        'redirect_url': 'https://www.google.com',
        'custom_logo': '',
        'txref': 'CD-102297-RV098299'
    });
    ```
    Below is an example of what your index.html may look like

    ```

                </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

6. Run app

    Before you test the app. Cordova doesn't allow navigation to external urls inside the app by default hence you may need to:
    - Add ```<allow-navigation href="*">``` to your config.xml
    - Replace the meta tag that sets your ```Content-Security-Policy``` with this
    ```
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="font-src 'self' data:; img-src * data:; default-src gap://ready file://* *; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' * ; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *">
    ```
    Now run:
    ```
    cordova run browser
    ```

## Deployment
Here are a few things to note
1. If you set ```liveMode``` to ```no``` then ensure that you're using your rave sandbox api keys i.e public and secret key
2. If you set ```liveMode``` to ```yes``` then ensure that you're using your rave live api keys i.e public and secret key
