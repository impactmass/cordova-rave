# Cordova Rave

> A Cordova extension to add [Rave](https://www.flutterwave.com) Pay Button into your hybrid apps builds.

This module helps you easily integrate Rave into your Cordova builds. Rave lets you receive payments locally and internationally with no hassles and zero set up fees. Read more about Rave [here](https://www.flutterwave.com).

### Installation
In your app directory:

`npm install cordova-rave`

### Setup
Two steps:

First, `cd node_modules/cordova-rave && npm start`

NB: If you get a warning of outdated npm dependency/DOS issue, please [read this](https://github.com/impactmass/cordova-rave/issues/11#issuecomment-293965034)

This step will prompt you for a few config values which you should get from your Rave dashboard. After which it creates a config file in the directory.
You can modify this file later if you need to.

Second, `npm run build`
This ultimately creates a `rave.js` file into your `www` directory. Link to this file in your root index template.
If you modify your config.json at anytime, you need to run the build again.

### Usage
Completing the setup above exposes a `initRavePay` function for you to call to tigger the payment modal.

Basic Usage: `initRavePay(options)`
* options.liveMode - (y/n) for setup only. gets the required script for live or test environment
* options.customer_email - (Required if customer_phone is not passed) Email of the customer
* txref - Transaction Reference (Required) (Unique per transaction)
* options.amount (if not passed, the Rave modal shows amount input)
* options.onclose (function) - Set behaviour onclose of the modal
* options.callback (function) - Set how you want to respond after payment is done

The fields you pass here gets merged (with preference) on your app-wide setup done above.
This final config is then passed Rave. See below more Rave options.
